<h1>Interest in I.T</h1>

<p>My interest in I.T would have to come from my dad. When we got our first coimputer at home I remeber him teaching himself HTML code and 
starting to build a website. 
I remember sitting there for hours watching him write code. As far as experience goes I have no formal experience. Mainly just fixing 
friends and family computers when they have problems. Next year I hope to build my own P.C</p>

<h1>Why RMIT</h1>

<p>I first started studying Bachelor in Technology (Game Design) through Mirdoch University but found it was not the course I wanted to do
as it was more the art side of I.T with lots of drawing and graphical design. 
When I wanted to change my course I saw that RMIT was offering Bachelor In Information Technology and jumped on it straight away. 
Mainly because in Melbourne when you think of technical qualifications RMIT is the first University that comest to mind. 
Second my brother in law went to RMIT and recomends it highly</p>

<h1>What I expect to learn</h1>

<p>During my studies I hope to gain an understanding of all facets of I.T. From this I hope to find a sector that really interests me and 
the be able to tailor my electives to dive deepr in that sector. Ultimatly I wish to gain employment into a sector 
I have a strong interest in, that I enjoy and that I am qualified in.</p>
