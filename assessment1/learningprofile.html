<h1> Reflection</h1>

<p>At this stage the results dont mean much to me as none of them were much of a surprise to me. They are a good reference point though 
as I know what I need to keep a focus on when given certain situations. As far as working in a team goes these will influence the way I 
contribute. So know instead of sitting back and going with what everyone else wants to do I know I need to make my ideas and feelings 
known. When forming a team these should be takern into account because to much of a certain personality type and we can start having problems.
For example if there are to many introverts then no one will share any ideas and the project wont seem cohesive.</p>
