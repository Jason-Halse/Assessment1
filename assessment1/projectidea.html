<h1> Project Idea</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>With the way access social media in todayâ€™s day in age being mainly through our smart devices I want to create an app that you are 
able to make posts, upload pictures and everything else you are wanting to put on social media. It will then send it to a server 
where it would be heavily encrypted and then uploaded to which ever platform was chosen by the user. This would hopefully prevent 
the data from being collected and shared. Hopefully greater protecting our privacy and that of our family.</p>
 
<h2>Motivation.</h2> 

<p>As most of the data we upload to social media platform like Facebook, Instagram, and twitter etc. is bought and sold for marketing 
purposes there is no way known just exactly what and how much data these collection agencies have on us. This is extremely 
worrying as I have to young daughters where their details and pictures of them are constantly being uploaded to Facebook and the likes. 
It becomes even more worrying when you think about the older, they get how much information would have been collected about them. 
This then becomes alarming when you realise that both are neither old enough to consent to their data being collected and that they 
are most of the time not even aware that they have been uploaded to Facebook etc. I have included an article addressing this exact issue.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>It will be an app that plugs into all social media platforms. Then from the app you can look at your chosen platform as you normally 
would. While this is happening, your data is being routed through a server where it is constantly being encrypted. By doing this you 
can comment, like, share, and upload without the worry of your data being collected. As it is the server doing the encryption and 
not the actual app your data would remain encrypted even if the app is deleted from the device. There would be a free service that 
would allow for social media only and a paid service that would allow for social media plus email, (plugging into all the major 
email applications), video calls and instant messaging. It would be a simple layout allowing with an emphasis on ease of use. 
I would want it to feel like you are using the exact social media platform you are intending to use. There would be a post section 
that would allow you to post to all available social media platforms with the push of a single button. Later, down the track after 
some more research I would hope to patch into the app an option to remove all marketing posts and pop ups from the social media platforms.</p>

<h2>Tools and Technology</h2>

<p>The main software I would need is an easy to use and robust SDK (software development kit). After doing some research I would be going 
for AWS as this offers seamless encryption. It also offers the tools needed to handle cloud infrastructure, servers, networking, and 3rd 
party API integration to name a few. It has the tools needed to create a web-based app or and an android development kit. This is setup 
to code in either Java or Python.</P>
 
<h2>Skills required</h2>
 
<p>The main skill required would be mobile app development specifically how to write java or python to run mobile apps. All the skills and 
software are already available it would just be a matter of pulling it all together. In saying that I hope by the end of my studies I 
would be able to proficiently write java code in order to create a mobile app.</p>
 
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>If the project is successful, I would hope that we could worry less about who and where our private data was going to because now it 
is being sold to the highest bidder. The main goal is to create a world where the children are not defined by the data that is out 
there of them before they are able to consent to sharing data. Hopefully it would force the social media platforms to look at and 
reform their privacy policies although I would not be holding my breath</p>
