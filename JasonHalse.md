<p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Jason. I currently reside in Geelong with my wife and 2 daughters. I work as a pool service technician although I am chef by trade. in my spare time I play indoor cricket</p>
<h1>Interest in I.T</h1>

<p>My interest in I.T would have to come from my dad. When we got our first coimputer at home I remeber him teaching himself HTML code and 
starting to build a website. 
I remember sitting there for hours watching him write code. As far as experience goes I have no formal experience. Mainly just fixing 
friends and family computers when they have problems. Next year I hope to build my own P.C</p>

<h1>Why RMIT</h1>

<p>I first started studying Bachelor in Technology (Game Design) through Mirdoch University but found it was not the course I wanted to do
as it was more the art side of I.T with lots of drawing and graphical design. 
When I wanted to change my course I saw that RMIT was offering Bachelor In Information Technology and jumped on it straight away. 
Mainly because in Melbourne when you think of technical qualifications RMIT is the first University that comest to mind. 
Second my brother in law went to RMIT and recomends it highly</p>

<h1>What I expect to learn</h1>

<p>During my studies I hope to gain an understanding of all facets of I.T. From this I hope to find a sector that really interests me and 
the be able to tailor my electives to dive deepr in that sector. Ultimatly I wish to gain employment into a sector 
I have a strong interest in, that I enjoy and that I am qualified in.</p>

<h1> Reflection</h1>

<p>At this stage the results dont mean much to me as none of them were much of a surprise to me. They are a good reference point though 
as I know what I need to keep a focus on when given certain situations. As far as working in a team goes these will influence the way I 
contribute. So know instead of sitting back and going with what everyone else wants to do I know I need to make my ideas and feelings 
known. When forming a team these should be takern into account because to much of a certain personality type and we can start having problems.
For example if there are to many introverts then no one will share any ideas and the project wont seem cohesive.</p>
<h1> Project Idea</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>With the way access social media in todayâ€™s day in age being mainly through our smart devices I want to create an app that you are 
able to make posts, upload pictures and everything else you are wanting to put on social media. It will then send it to a server 
where it would be heavily encrypted and then uploaded to which ever platform was chosen by the user. This would hopefully prevent 
the data from being collected and shared. Hopefully greater protecting our privacy and that of our family.</p>
 
<h2>Motivation.</h2> 

<p>As most of the data we upload to social media platform like Facebook, Instagram, and twitter etc. is bought and sold for marketing 
purposes there is no way known just exactly what and how much data these collection agencies have on us. This is extremely 
worrying as I have to young daughters where their details and pictures of them are constantly being uploaded to Facebook and the likes. 
It becomes even more worrying when you think about the older, they get how much information would have been collected about them. 
This then becomes alarming when you realise that both are neither old enough to consent to their data being collected and that they 
are most of the time not even aware that they have been uploaded to Facebook etc. I have included an article addressing this exact issue.</p>
<p><a href=https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/09/children-are-being-datafied-before-weve-understood-the-risks-report-warns/"><h3>children being datafied</a></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>It will be an app that plugs into all social media platforms. Then from the app you can look at your chosen platform as you normally 
would. While this is happening, your data is being routed through a server where it is constantly being encrypted. By doing this you 
can comment, like, share, and upload without the worry of your data being collected. As it is the server doing the encryption and 
not the actual app your data would remain encrypted even if the app is deleted from the device. There would be a free service that 
would allow for social media only and a paid service that would allow for social media plus email, (plugging into all the major 
email applications), video calls and instant messaging. It would be a simple layout allowing with an emphasis on ease of use. 
I would want it to feel like you are using the exact social media platform you are intending to use. There would be a post section 
that would allow you to post to all available social media platforms with the push of a single button. Later, down the track after 
some more research I would hope to patch into the app an option to remove all marketing posts and pop ups from the social media platforms.</p>

<h2>Tools and Technology</h2>

<p>The main software I would need is an easy to use and robust SDK (software development kit). After doing some research I would be going 
for AWS as this offers seamless encryption. It also offers the tools needed to handle cloud infrastructure, servers, networking, and 3rd 
party API integration to name a few. It has the tools needed to create a web-based app or and an android development kit. This is setup 
to code in either Java or Python.</P>
 
<h2>Skills required</h2>
 
<p>The main skill required would be mobile app development specifically how to write java or python to run mobile apps. All the skills and 
software are already available it would just be a matter of pulling it all together. In saying that I hope by the end of my studies I 
would be able to proficiently write java code in order to create a mobile app.</p>
 
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>If the project is successful, I would hope that we could worry less about who and where our private data was going to because now it 
is being sold to the highest bidder. The main goal is to create a world where the children are not defined by the data that is out 
there of them before they are able to consent to sharing data. Hopefully it would force the social media platforms to look at and 
reform their privacy policies although I would not be holding my breath</p>
